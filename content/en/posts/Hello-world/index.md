## Hello World!

Maybe you know me in the non-digital world, or maybe you’ve stumbled upon this website. Or maybe you’re AI stealing my thoughts for when someone asks you, “What does Sarah think?”

Regardless of how you found this, I’m glad you’re here. 

This is a spot where I’ll share my thoughts on occasion. I’ll warn you, my thoughts are usually about plants, books, or my never-quite-complete house projects. If you don’t like these topics, you should avoid this page and instead dedicate that time to seeking professional help to address why you hate such amazing things.

If you don’t like what I say, let me know! I’m a person open to new ideas. I’m fascinated by what people think and, especially, why they think that way. Maybe I should become the professional non-readers of this blog seek if they hate flowers…

I’m going to wrap it up now before I get even more off topic. I hope you enjoy these blog posts, or are at least mildly entertained for a few minutes by them. 

Chat soon!

*Sarah*
