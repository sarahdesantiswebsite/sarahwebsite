## To Catch A Perrdator

Despite dwarfing Charlotte Lucas in spinsterhood years, I have yet to be visited by the Cat Distribution System. It’s really for the best because my bajillion plants would surely poison any cat that steps foot into my house. Still… I’m a *little* offended.

Over the summer, I began noticing a black cat sunning itself on a warm strip of wood chips in my backyard. I asked around the block, and discovered that there were two black cats and two different neighbors had named them. The names that won out were Mr. Darcy, a standoffish black cat, and Mr. Bingley, a friendlier black cat. My neighbors befriended Mr. Bingley, convinced him to move in, and had him fixed. He now lives a very cushy life rivaling Netherfield Park.

Mr. Darcy remains at large. I began noticing pawprints in the mud and snow and decided I would try to befriend him. Extremely cold weather was forecasted (and it *still* hasn’t subsided…) so I built a little cat house for him. I put out some food. Then I waited.

And by waited, I mean went to bed. The next morning, the food was gone, and I used doorbell camera footage to check on who stopped by for Sarah’s 24-hour diner. To my surprise, it wasn’t Mr. Darcy – it was a tuxedo cat with extra white socks and face. 

A side note: I have outdoor cameras for security, but I primarily use them to check the weather without getting out of bed and to watch the neighborhood cats. I also check on my plants when I’m away, just because I miss them. It’s a great use of money.

The tuxedo cat was a cutie pie, and I decided that I could befriend him (or her). I put out more food. The next day the food was gone and the camera footage showed… a gigantic gray cat. Like, the equivalent of that sheep that hid in the mountains for years to avoid shearing, but cat-sized. 

I watched more footage to see if the tuxedo cat stopped by. I didn’t spot him, but I did see Mr. Darcy come by for food about an hour after gray cat slinked off.

Mind you, it’s sub-freezing temperatures so it’s very unlikely these are household cats that were let out. And the sightings usually happen between 11 p.m. and dawn. 

I’m determined now to befriend at least one of these cats. It has to happen, right?
