#I don't think anything in this tags bin does a lot. The tags worked even without implementing them here. There is one exception: translation. This theme is capable of having different language editions. There, the tag can flip from one translation to another with ease. If you aren't interested in that feature, you probably won't have to mess with much in this directory.
